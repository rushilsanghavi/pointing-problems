                                        SYSTEMATIC DISASTER MANAGEMENT
                           
                           
            The basic aim of our initiative is to provide support to the disaster affected people. This would be achieved by providing basic necessities like food, drinking water, clothes etc. This work could be carried out by using any feasible transport like helicopters, boats, trucks etc. depending on the type of natural calamity. 
            
            
            Our first objective will be to write a program to prioritise the disaster prone zones and arrange them in the corresponding order. This would be created by collecting data from local resources. These local resources can be anything like scientific instruments used to measure disaster proximity, data from citizens(disaster affected people), data through satellites or any such equipments.
            
            
            
            This data would in turn be returned to the transport management, which would in turn organise the schedule for sending the basic necessities to the disaster prone areas. Our second objective would be to create a people-friendly atmosphere to avoid any fights in the background. Because of critical shortage of resources, there would be chances of fights. To avoid this we would like to create a token system. This would ensure that each disaster affected person would get equal amount of resources. It would also help in creating a list of people who have been without essenetial resources and for how many days. Thus it would help in creating a clearer picture of the situation(crises). This list would give a rough idea about how many kgs. food, medicines, clothes and other necessities to be carried. 
            
            Thus with our program we would try to reach every disaster stricken human being and help them in every possible way.
